# F1 Driver Performance Over Time :checkered_flag:
<b></b>
<H2>Introduction to the Problem</H2>
<b>I chose this data set because I have recently become interested in F1 racing and I loved reading about more drivers and their stats through this dataset. It gave me a natural guiding question to ask that I am genuinely interested in finding the answer to.
My guiding question is How has the average win rate changed over the decades? A win rate is assigned to each driver and it is calculated by (Race Wins/Race Entries). I want to communicate how the driver win rate has progressed over the years, find out which countries have the drivers with the highest win rate throughout the years, see if drivers with more time racing have higher win rates compared to newer drivers, measure driver efficiency, and test to see if there is a correlation between pole positions race wins across drivers. My chosen audience is other F1 fans and it matters to be able to prove or disprove if seniority gives drivers an advantage, to see what countries are producing winners, and even just to fulfill personal curiosity as a new fan who is very interested in the analysis aspect of the sport.

<h2>Data Understanding/Visualization</h2>
<b>A polished, audience-facing story published on your portfolio site. This should focus on clarity, visuals, and insights rather than technical details.
Your post should include:
Defines the problem or question you are addressing
Presents multiple coded visualizations that walk the audience through a clear story
Highlights key insights and why they matter (impact/implications)
Written for an audience — no code snippets or step-by-step cleaning (those go in the technical report)
</b>
<b>I started with calculating the mean win rate for each country and further transitioning that into my first visual which is the distribution of win rates by country. This boxplot shows clear outliers with the highest win rates in the top 25 countries producing f1 drivers over the years. This focus on the spread of driver data especially helps highlight outliers in racing and which countries are consistent in their rates.

I then transitioned to my next question, how have win rates changed over time, including major winning countries and decade win rate averages.

<b>Next, I compared the data to see if pole positions had an effect on driver race wins. I used regression line to test if there was a positive correlation,</b>

<h2>Findings/Analysis</h2>
<b>Think of this like a blog post, a news article with charts, or a case study for a professional portfolio. The audience is non-technical: classmates, employers, or a curious reader who wants to know what the data reveals.
Goal: Tell a story, highlight insights, and communicate “why it matters.”
Style: Clear, engaging narrative with visuals woven into the story.
What to include:
Problem / guiding question(s) (framed simply)
Visualizations that lead the reader through the story
Insights and implications (what should we learn? why does it matter?)
➡️ Portfolio Post Example (fictional snippet):
“When we look at Delhi’s air quality over the past decade, the trend is clear: PM2.5 levels spike sharply during winter months. The visualization below shows how those peaks align with the festival season. This raises important questions about public health during those months, and whether interventions could reduce exposure…”
(Notice: storytelling tone, a chart theoretically included inline, no code or step-by-step data cleaning.)
It tells a story or argues a point in plain language.
It walks the audience through visuals that support the narrative.
It highlights why the data matters.
