# F1 Driver Performance Over Time :checkered_flag: (ITCS 4122 Project 1)
<b></b>
<H2>Introduction to the Problem</H2>
<b>I chose this data set because I have recently become interested in F1 racing and I loved reading about more drivers and their stats through this dataset. It gave me a natural guiding question to ask that I am genuinely interested in finding the answer to.
My guiding question is How has the average win rate changed over the decades? A win rate is assigned to each driver and it is calculated by (Race Wins/Race Entries). I want to communicate how the driver win rate has progressed over the years, find out which countries have the drivers with the highest win rate throughout the years, see if drivers with more time racing have higher win rates compared to newer drivers, measure driver efficiency, and test to see if there is a correlation between pole positions race wins across drivers. My chosen audience is other F1 fans and it matters to be able to prove or disprove if seniority gives drivers an advantage, to see what countries are producing winners, and even just to fulfill personal curiosity as a new fan who is very interested in the analysis aspect of the sport.
