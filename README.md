# F1 Driver Performance Over Time :checkered_flag:
<b></b>
<H2>Introduction to the Problem</H2>
<b>I chose this data set because I have recently become interested in F1 racing and I loved reading about more drivers and their stats through this dataset. It gave me a natural guiding question to ask that I am genuinely interested in finding the answer to.
My guiding question is How has the average win rate changed over the decades? A win rate is assigned to each driver and it is calculated by (Race Wins/Race Entries). I want to communicate how the driver win rate has progressed over the years, find out which countries have the drivers with the highest win rate throughout the years, see if drivers with more time racing have higher win rates compared to newer drivers, measure driver efficiency, and test to see if there is a correlation between pole positions race wins across drivers. My chosen audience is other F1 fans and it matters to be able to prove or disprove if seniority gives drivers an advantage, to see what countries are producing winners, and even just to fulfill personal curiosity as a new fan who is very interested in the analysis aspect of the sport.

<h2>Data Understanding/Visualization</h2>
<b>I started with calculating the mean win rate for each country and further transitioning that into my first visual which is the distribution of win rates by country. This boxplot shows clear outliers with the highest win rates in the top 25 countries producing f1 drivers over the years. This focus on the spread of driver data especially helps highlight outliers in racing and which countries are consistent in their rates.

I then transitioned to my next question, how have win rates changed over time, including major winning countries and decade win rate averages.

<b>Next, I compared the data to see if pole positions had an effect on driver race wins. I used regression line to test if there was a positive correlation, where we see a clear positive regression with higher pole positions leading to higher win rates overall.</b>

  <b> My final visualization was a test to see if career length had anything to do with the win rates of the majority of drivers while also highlighting top performers in F1 and seeing what their career length was compared to their win rates. To properly make my point I ensured that the top performers were clearly marked and we see different career lengths for each of these performers. However, we do see an overall positive correlation indicating that the longer a drivers racing career, the more wins they are accumulating. </b>
