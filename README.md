# F1 Driver Performance Over Time :checkered_flag:
<b></b>
<H2>Introduction to the Problem</H2>
<b>I chose this dataset because I have recently become interested in Formula 1 racing, and I loved reading about more drivers and their statistics through this dataset. My observations give me a natural guiding question to ask that I am genuinely interested in finding the answer to.
My guiding question is “how has the average win rate changed over the decades?” A win rate is assigned to each driver, and it is calculated by (Race Wins/Race Entries). I want to communicate how the driver win rate has progressed over the years, find out which countries have the drivers with the highest win rate throughout the years, see if drivers with more time racing have higher win rates compared to newer drivers, measure driver efficiency, and test to see if there is a correlation between pole positions and race wins across drivers. My chosen audience is other Formula 1 fans, old and new. My analysis aims to prove or disprove if seniority gives drivers an advantage, to see which countries are producing winners, and even  fulfill personal curiosity as a new fan who is very interested in the data aspect of the sport.

<h2>Data Understanding/Visualization</h2>
<b>I started by calculating the mean win rate for each country and further transitioning that into my first visual, which is the distribution of win rates by country. This boxplot defines clear outliers with the highest win rates in the top 25 countries that produced F1 drivers over the years. This focus on the spread of driver data especially helps highlight outliers in racing and which countries are consistent in their rates.

<b></b>To explore how win rates have changed over time, I created a chart that compares individual drivers by decade, highlighting major winning countries and overlaying decade win rate averages. This makes it easy to see which nations provided dominant drivers during certain eras, but also how the sport has evolved over time.

<b> Next, I compared the data to see if pole positions had an effect on driver race wins. I used a regression line to test if a positive correlation occurs. We observe a clear positive regression, with higher pole positions leading to higher win rates overall.</b>

  <b> My final visualization was a test to find out if career length had a correlation with the win rates of the majority of drivers. I also highlighted top performers in F1 and saw what their career length was compared to their win rates. I ensured that the top performers were clearly marked, and we see different career lengths for each of these performers. However, we do see an overall positive correlation, indicating that the longer a driver's racing career, the more wins they accumulate. </b>

<h2>Findings/Analysis</h2>
<b>
Through my findings, I found that the average F1 win rates have shifted notably over the decades; the visuals demonstrated shifts tied to both eras of dominance and competitive depth. The decade averages showed eras like the 1980s and 2000s were shaped by a handful of standout performers, while more recent data shows a leveling effect as competition shifts. When observing nationalities, the analysis revealed that a small group of countries consistently produces the majority of winners, highlighting that the win rates within a country can vary widely through the boxplot visuals. It shows that not every driver from a high-performing nation becomes a champion, and not every nation that produces champions produces them consistently. Exploring career length, I found that time in the sport does correlate with more wins, but the relationship is not as strong as I originally expected. Talent and team advantage can outweigh career length. The top performers highlighted are prime examples of this concept, as their unique combination of skill, opportunity, and timing has allowed them to succeed. Finally, the correlation between pole positions and wins reinforced the idea that starting at the front provides a clear advantage, but it is not the whole story. Taken together, these insights give fans a richer understanding of how many factors come together to create success in F1. There are correlations, but not just talent or experience guarantees success. For new fans like me, this analysis not only answers my guiding questions but also provides a clearer understanding of how the sport has shifted over time and how the sport might evolve over the next decade.
