# F1 Driver Performance Over Time :checkered_flag: (ITCS 4122 Project 1)
<b></b>
<H2>Introduction to the Problem</H2>
<b>The dataset is titled “F1 Drivers dataset” and it is from Kaggle. The data set has 22 columns and contains information about over 800 F1 drivers that give various information about each driver, derived from the F1 archives. The variables are a mix of numerical, categorical, and string values. I chose this data set because I have recently become interested in F1 racing and I loved reading about more drivers and their stats through this dataset. It gave me a natural guiding question to ask that I am genuinely interested in finding the answer to.
My guiding question is How has the average win rate changed over the decades? A win rate is assigned to each driver and it is calculated by (Race Wins/Race Entries). I want to communicate how the driver win rate has progressed over the years, find out which countries have the drivers with the highest win rate throughout the years, see if drivers with more time racing have higher win rates compared to newer drivers, measure driver efficiency, and test to see if there is a correlation between pole positions race wins across drivers. My chosen audience is other F1 fans and it matters to be able to prove or disprove if seniority gives drivers an advantage, to see what countries are producing winners, and even just to fulfill personal curiosity as a new fan who is very interested in the analysis aspect of the sport.
There are no missing values in the dataset making the pre-processing much easier to figure out, I anticipate that I will have to put some thought and time into creating the visuals in the way I am envisioning them in my head but I am excited for the challenge!</b>
